# #30DayMapChallenge 2022 

## Day 8: Baltimore Neighborhoods by Population
Prompt #8 from the 30 Day Map Challenge was to use data from Open Street Map. I used Folium and Geopandas to create [this map](https://deepnote.com/@nicoledesignsdata/Baltimore-Neighborhoods-f74fdc08-0466-4feb-b34b-1d88a7f90561) in Deepnote.

## Day 10: "Bad" Map, Spinal Map of Tampa Bay
Prompt #10 from the 30 Day Map Challenge was to create a "bad" map, so I made this [Spinal Map of Tampa Bay](https://deepnote.com/@nicoledesignsdata/30DayMapChallenge-2a82fafc-8964-4c12-93c0-b9d135f4aa1c) with Folium and GeoPandas in Python.
